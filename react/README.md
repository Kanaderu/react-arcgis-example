# Simple React Projects for Proof of Concept

The projects are initially generated with `create-react-app` and stripped away excess components from there. Projects support hot reloading out of the box directly from the `create-react-app` template.

# Quick Start

Each folder is a separate small project to introduce some code. It may also require running a backend to communicate and work properly depending on the project.

Node needs to be installed. Run the following commands to get started in any project.

```
npm install   # install local packages in node_modules/ for the project
npm run start # run the project locally
```

Alternatively `yarn` can be used as well.

```
yarn       # install local packages in node_modules/ for the project
yarn start # run the project locally
```
